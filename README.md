# Obsidian Nightfall v0.10
#### A Developer's GitHub Page Theme

**Obsidian Nightfall** is a custom Jekyll theme designed specifically for developers who want to showcase their GitHub repositories on a personalized website automatically. This theme can be used as your main GitHub Page (`username.github.io`) or within any sub-repository. It provides a sleek, modern, and dark-themed interface with a focus on readability and usability. [Demo](https://volkansah.github.io/Obsidian-Nightfall/)

## Key Features

- **Automatic GitHub Repository Display**: The theme dynamically fetches and displays your GitHub repositories.
- **Modal Pop-ups for Repository Details**: View repository details, including README files, within modal pop-ups, ensuring a seamless browsing experience.
- **Responsive and Dark-Themed Design**: A Bootstrap-based dark theme that looks great on all devices.
- **Automated Deployment with GitHub Actions**: Automatically build and deploy your site using GitHub Actions.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Fork the Repository

1. **Fork this repository**: Click the "Fork" button at the top right of this repository page to create a copy under your own GitHub account.

2. **Rename the Repository**: After forking, rename the repository to `username.github.io` if you want to use it as your main GitHub Page, or to any other name if you want to use it as a project page.

### Step 2: Update Configuration on GitHub

1. **_config.yml**: Open the `_config.yml` file directly on GitHub and update the following fields:
   - `title`: Set this to the title of your website.
   - `description`: A short description of your site.
   - `url`: Set this to `https://your-username.github.io` if it's your main GitHub Page, or `https://your-username.github.io/repo-name` if it's a sub-repo.
   - `baseurl`: Leave this empty for the main page or set it to `/repo-name` for a sub-repo.

2. **index.md**: Customize the `index.md` to personalize your landing page. The page automatically lists your repositories.
3. **Exclude Repos**:
   - If there are repositories you don’t want to display, you can exclude them by modifying the filtering function in the `index.md` file. 
   - Open `index.md` and locate the following section:
   
   ```javascript
   let filteredData = data.filter(repo => {
       return !repo.fork && 
              repo.name !== 'repo-name-to-exclude';
   });
   ```

### Step 3: Personalize Your Site

1. **Replace the Logo**: Upload your logo to the `assets/img/` directory directly on GitHub and update the logo path in `_layouts/default.html`.
2. **Modify Content**: Edit `index.md` and other content files to fit your personal style and information.
3. **Exclude Repos**: If there are repositories you don’t want to display, list them in the filtering function in `index.md`.

### Step 4: Set Up GitHub Actions for Automatic Deployment

1. **Set Up Secrets**:
   - Go to your repository settings on GitHub.
   - Navigate to "Secrets and variables" > "Actions".
   - Click on "New repository secret".
   - Name it `GH_TOKEN` and paste your [GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
   - Save the secret.

2. **GitHub Actions Workflow**:
   - The workflow file located in `.github/workflows/` is already set up to automatically build and deploy your site whenever you push changes to the `main` branch.
   - **Tip:** Rename the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file to `.github/workflows/deploy.yml.example` to prevent the actions from running during setup. Once your setup is complete, rename `deploy.yml.example` back to `deploy.yml` to enable the deployment process.


### Step 5: Deploy Your Site

1. **Commit Changes on GitHub**:
   - After making all the changes directly on GitHub, commit them.

2. **View Your Site**:
   - Go to `https://your-username.github.io` (or `https://your-username.github.io/repo-name` for sub-repos) to see your live site.
